     =========================================================

* **Added MCS lock.**

  MCS lock provides scalability by spinning on a CPU/thread local variable
  which avoids expensive cache bouncings.
  It provides fairness by maintaining a list of acquirers and passing
  the lock to each CPU/thread in the order they acquired the lock.

* **Updated the EAL Pseudo-random Number Generator.**

  The lrand48()-based rte_rand() function is replaced with a
  DPDK-native combined Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR)
  pseudo-random number generator (PRNG).

  This new PRNG implementation is multi-thread safe, provides
  higher-quality pseudo-random numbers (including full 64 bit
  support) and improved performance.

  In addition, <rte_random.h> is extended with a new function
  rte_rand_max() which supplies unbiased, bounded pseudo-random
  numbers.

* **Updated the bnxt PMD.**

  Updated the bnxt PMD. The major enhancements include:

  * Performance optimizations in non-vector Tx path
  * Added support for SSE vector mode
  * Updated HWRM API to version 1.10.0.74

  handshake between two separate hosts and can share local memory for peer
  host to directly access.

* **Updated IPSec library Header Reconstruction.**

  Updated the IPSec library with ECN and DSCP field header reconstruction
  feature followed by RFC4301. The IPSec-secgw sample application is also
  updated to support this feature by default.

* Removed KNI ethtool, CONFIG_RTE_KNI_KMOD_ETHTOOL, support.

* build: armv8 crypto extension is disabled.


API Changes
-----------

.. This section should contain API changes. Sample format:

   * sample: Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the API change
     which was announced in the previous releases and made in this release.
     Start with a scope label like "ethdev:".
     Use fixed width quotes for ``function_names`` or ``struct_names``.
     Use the past tense.

   This section is a comment. Do not overwrite or remove it.
   Also, make sure to start the actual text at the margin.
   =========================================================

* The ``rte_mem_config`` structure has been made private. The new accessor
  ``rte_mcfg_*`` functions were introduced to provide replacement for direct
  access to the shared mem config.

* The network structures, definitions and functions have
  been prefixed by ``rte_`` to resolve conflicts with libc headers.

* malloc: The function ``rte_malloc_set_limit`` was never implemented
  is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

* cryptodev: the ``uint8_t *data`` member of ``key`` structure in the xforms
  structure (``rte_crypto_cipher_xform``, ``rte_crypto_auth_xform``, and
  ``rte_crypto_aead_xform``) have been changed to ``const uint8_t *data``.

* eventdev: No longer marked as experimental.

  The eventdev functions are no longer marked as experimental, and have
  become part of the normal DPDK API and ABI. Any future ABI changes will be
  announced at least one release before the ABI change is made. There are no
  ABI breaking changes planned.

* ip_frag: IP fragmentation library converts input mbuf into fragments
  using input MTU size via ``rte_ipv4_fragment_packet`` interface.
  Once fragmentation is done, each ``mbuf->ol_flags`` are set to enable IP
  checksum H/W offload irrespective of the platform capability.
  Cleared IP checksum H/W offload flag from the library. The application must
  set this flag if it is supported by the platform and application wishes to
  use it.

* ip_frag: IP reassembly library converts the list of fragments into a
  reassembled packet via ``rte_ipv4_frag_reassemble_packet`` interface.
  Once reassembly is done, ``mbuf->ol_flags`` are set to enable IP checksum H/W
  offload irrespective of the platform capability. Cleared IP checksum H/W
  offload flag from the library. The application must set this flag if it is
  supported by the platform and application wishes to use it.


ABI Changes
-----------

.. This section should contain ABI changes. Sample format:

   * sample: Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the ABI change
     which was announced in the previous releases and made in this release.
     Start with a scope label like "ethdev:".
     Use fixed width quotes for ``function_names`` or ``struct_names``.
     Use the past tense.

   This section is a comment. Do not overwrite or remove it.
   Also, make sure to start the actual text at the margin.
   =========================================================

* eventdev: Event based Rx adapter callback

  The mbuf pointer array in the event eth Rx adapter callback
  has been replaced with an event array. Using
  an event array allows the application to change attributes
  of the events enqueued by the SW adapter.

  The callback can drop packets and populate
  a callback argument with the number of dropped packets.
  Add a Rx adapter stats field to keep track of the total
  number of dropped packets.

* cryptodev: New member in ``rte_cryptodev_config`` to allow applications to
  disable features supported by the crypto device. Only the following features
  would be allowed to be disabled this way,

  - ``RTE_CRYPTODEV_FF_SYMMETRIC_CRYPTO``
  - ``RTE_CRYPTODEV_FF_ASYMMETRIC_CRYPTO``
  - ``RTE_CRYPTODEV_FF_SECURITY``

  Disabling unused features would facilitate efficient usage of HW/SW offload.

* bbdev: New operations and parameters added to support new 5GNR operations.
  The bbdev ABI is still kept experimental.
